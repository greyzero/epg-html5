# epg-html5

This is a very early release of an Electronic Programming Guide written in html5. 

The goal of this project is to emulate the pay for cable experience.  

This will be done with a website that has a means to drag n drop local video files onto a local network server running a EPG menu to create a schedule of tv channels.

The current release only supports predefined channels encoded in a single webm file.
